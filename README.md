# Network-Pentesting

Metasploitable2 is a vulnerable virtual machine intentionally designed for penetration testing and learning purposes. It contains numerous security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, allowing security professionals to test their skills and tools in a controlled environment.

During your pentesting on the Metasploitable2 machine, you likely followed a systematic approach to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. This process generally includes the following steps:

Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and services running.

Scanning: Using various scanning tools like Nmap to discover open ports, identify running services, and gather more detailed information about the target.

Enumeration: Extracting additional information about the target system, such as user accounts, network shares, and system configurations.

Vulnerability Assessment: Identifying and assessing vulnerabilities within the target system or network using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or manual analysis.

Exploitation: Actively exploiting the discovered vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over the target system. Metasploit Framework, an open-source penetration testing tool, is commonly used for this purpose.

Post-Exploitation: Once access is obtained, further exploration of the compromised system, privilege escalation, and maintaining persistence may be performed.

Documentation and Reporting: Thoroughly documenting the entire pentesting process, including the steps taken, vulnerabilities found, and recommendations for mitigation. This report helps stakeholders understand the security risks and make informed decisions for improving their system's security.
